# ai-in-practice
I have dedicated this space to documenting some of the challenges that I have faced and then solved during my AI model development career. Here, I will try to focus more on the aspects that define approach to an AI problem. Will try to keep making changes to it as I learn more and more. Hopefully, one day, this repo could serve as a concise guideline for budding data scientists and myself when I am older and forget things :)<br><br>



<h3>Checklist of TODO items when presented with an AI Project</h3>
<ol>
<li>Find words on the topic by Googling it over</li>
<li>Find tools/techniques that I can use, so I dont have to reinvent the wheel all over again</li>
<li>Find research (papers/patentS) that pertain to the particular problem</li>
<li>Find datasets that would help myself start out</li>
<li>Find evaluation metrics so I can have a goal to optimize</li>
<li>Find code from the papers that already exists so I can reuse it for my experiments</li>
<li>Replicate results of paper with available code or write code to achieve the same</li>
<li>Code, Test, Repeat</li>
</ol>
